## HTML
  
  I used visual studio code and added a basic wireframe of html to my index.html file. I then added a header element and added
  the role to increase accessibility (setting it to "banner"). I also added main, article, and footer elements and added roles
  to each of them as well. 
  
## CSS
  Primarily used classes to apply my css stylings to my html elements. Did include some hover functionality to the links and 
  search bar. Could refactor and use sections in my html to divide each element more evenly. Also had some issues with creating
  the sizing of my elements, and took some shortcuts to get it to "look good"

Overall I think it works, definitely could use some improvements, and really is a copy of the more traditional Google site. I 
decided to time myself on this, and basically got it down and pushed to a git repo within 2 hours. Will be interesting to see
how long it takes me when I swing back to this. Anyways, thanks for reading and checking it out.
